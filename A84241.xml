            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks</hi> proceedings and fortunate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe at Sea is very joyfull and dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable to all true Chriſtians, as will appeare by theſe particulars fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, for it hath been often times ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſied unto divers worthy perſons of this Realme, from many of their Friends, that have now offices under his Lordſhip, of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156071:3"/>his brave and heroicke actions againſt the Malignant party, that now lye lurking in many corners of the Sea, and of his brave adventures in divers places therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, as <hi>Humber,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh Seas,</hi> and the courage that all the Seamen and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners take againſt all ſuch perſons, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to loſe their lives in the defence of his Majeſties perſon, the Honourable Court of Parliament, and the Lawes and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and that they will ſight it out to the laſt man, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they encounter with, being reſolved never to yeeld unto <hi>Englands</hi> Foe or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
            <p>The Honourable Court of Parliament (the great Councell of this Kingdome) upon Munday laſt received advertiſement and information of the proceedings of Captaine <hi>Kettleby</hi> and Captaine <hi>Stradling</hi> upon the Iriſh Seas, to the hazzard of that Kingdome, and the utter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all the true Proteſtants in that Kingdome; therefore the Honourable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156071:3"/>Court of Parliament having taken into ſerious conſideration the proceedings of theſe Pyrars, and reſolved to ſend a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and in the ſame propounded theſe following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions: Whereby he might deſtroy thoſe wicked and cruell perſons, who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lye in waite to deſtroy and ruine the true Proteſtants both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they having had information of the proceedings of the aforeſaid Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and that they had taken an Engliſh Ship that was going with Beefe to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Proteſtants, having in the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſuites of clothes to cloath the poore Souldiers that are now in a miſerable and naked condition, therefore they deſired the ſaid Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> to ſend ſome of his Ships to the Iriſh Seas, for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of thoſe wretched and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Perſons, which queſtionleſſe hee will ſuddenly doe, and I pray God that all ſuch and the like perſons as they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156071:4"/>are, may be catcht in their owne ſnares, but becauſe I am loth to leave and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with theſe ſad tydings, I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved to lay open to the Readers view many joyfull and remarkable paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which hath hapned ſince his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſetting forth from <hi>London,</hi> upon Friday night laſt His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence tooke up his lodging at Saint <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> and from thence, upon the next day, being Saturday, he tooke his Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Northampton,</hi> and as it is credibly reported, he arrived there that night, and from thence his reſolved to march into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> intending to ſcour that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all thoſe Cavaleers that doe now in a moſt tyrannicall way execute the poore diſtreſſed Inhabitants, taking from them Horſes, Kine, Sheepe, and all other kinde of Cattell, but it is thought that when he appeares in that County that many of the Cavaleers will betake themſelves to flight, as divers of their Companions hath done in <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi> and <hi>Bedfordſhire,</hi> for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156071:4"/>when that they heard that His Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was marching and comming neere thoſe places, where many was billited, they dueſt not withſtand him but betooke themſelves to their heeles, and ſo they doe in many other places, when they heare that the Lord Generall is neer. The County comes in very faſt to aid and aſſiſt his Excellence, and ſuch is the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of him, that I hope the Lord of Hoſts will crowne him with Fame and Victory, and make him able to reſiſt all that ſhall oppoſe him, for he is reſolved, and thereupon ſet downe his Reſolution to loſe his deareſt blood in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of that cauſe which he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke, being comfortable tidings and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py intelligence for all thoſe that wiſheth well to this happy Reformation, that wee have ſuch a worthy Generall, that doth not thinke his deare blood too much to be ſpilt in our cauſe, and I hope that he will make <hi>Englands</hi> foes in a ſhort time feare and tremble at his very Name, as they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156071:5"/>did his Fathers before him in forraign Countries, God grant him happy and fortunate ſucceſſe in this his conſtant Reſolution, and let all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians daily ſend their prayers to the Almighty for his preſervation from all treacherous conſpiracies, that ſo we may have joy and comfort from him, as our Predeceſſours have had from his Father, a man who was infinitely beloved throughout all <hi>England.</hi>
